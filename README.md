# 🎛 Mission Control

A personal operations dashboard built on Next.js + Neon Postgres, deployed on Netlify. Tracks tasks, ticket flips, agent activity, deal scanning, chat, docs, and more — in one centralized interface.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (Next.js 14 app router)
- **Neon DB** — a serverless Postgres database ([neon.tech](https://neon.tech))
- **Netlify** — hosting + serverless functions

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` for local dev, or set these in Netlify's environment settings:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | Neon connection string (`postgresql://user:pass@...neon.tech/neondb`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANCE` | ✅ | Instance label — `personal` or `biz`. Controls feature visibility. |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Optional | Enables Telegram chat integration |

**Example `.env.local`:**
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@ep-xxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANCE=personal
```

## First-Time Setup

> **For the AI agent:** You cannot create the Neon database or Netlify site yourself — the human owner needs to do two quick things first. Ask them clearly, then you handle the rest.

### Step 0: Ask your human what type of instance this is

Before anything else, ask:

> "What is this Mission Control instance for? Give me a short description (e.g., 'personal projects', 'business with my partner Morris', 'client dashboard'). I'll configure it accordingly."

Their answer determines the `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANCE` value you'll set later: `personal` or `biz`.

### Step 1: Ask your human to create a Neon database

Send them this message:

> "I need you to create a database for Mission Control. It takes 2 minutes:
> 1. Go to **neon.tech** and sign in (or create a free account)
> 2. Click **New Project**
> 3. Name it anything (e.g. 'mission-control')
> 4. Pick the region closest to you
> 5. Click **Create Project**
> 6. You'll see a **connection string** that starts with `postgresql://` — copy the whole thing and send it to me
>
> That's all I need. I'll handle everything else."

Save the connection string they give you — this is your `DATABASE_URL`.

### Step 2: Ask your human to create a Netlify site

Send them this message:

> "I also need a Netlify account to host the dashboard:
> 1. Go to **app.netlify.com** and sign in (or create a free account)
> 2. Go to **User Settings → Applications → Personal access tokens**
> 3. Click **New access token**, name it 'openclaw', and click **Generate**
> 4. Copy the token (starts with `nfp_`) and send it to me
>
> I'll create the site and deploy everything automatically."

Once you have the Netlify token, create the site yourself:
```bash
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=<token> npx netlify-cli sites:create --name <pick-a-name>
```

### Step 3: Clone and deploy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spiceit1/openclaw-mission-control.git
cd mission-control
npm install
```

Deploy to Netlify with the DATABASE_URL set:
```bash
# Set env vars on the Netlify site
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=<token> npx netlify-cli env:set DATABASE_URL "<connection-string>" --site <site-id>
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=<token> npx netlify-cli env:set NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANCE "personal" --site <site-id>

# Deploy
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=<token> npx netlify-cli deploy --prod --site <site-id>
```

### Step 4: Bootstrap the database

Visit `/setup` on your deployed site:

1. **Verify DB connection** — the status card should show "Connected"
2. **Click "Run Migration"** — creates all 22 `mc_` tables in your Neon DB
3. **Click "Seed Defaults"** — inserts base config rows (team roster, scanner rules, etc.)
4. All pages will now work correctly

### Step 5: Verify everything works

Click **Verify All Routes** on the `/setup` page. All checks should show green (✅). If any fail, check the error message and ensure migration and seeding completed successfully.

> **That's it.** The human did 2 things (Neon + Netlify tokens). The agent did everything else.

## Pages

| Page | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | `/` | Overview cards — tasks, flips, agents, scanner status |
| Tasks | `/tasks` | Kanban-style task board with priorities |
| *(extensible)* | | *Add custom pages as needed for your use case* |
| Factory | `/factory` | Sub-agent registry — spawned agents, status, task summaries |
| Inbox | `/inbox` | Agent-to-agent message inbox |
| Chat | `/chat` | Telegram chat history viewer |
| Projects | `/projects` | Project tracking |
| Docs | `/docs` | Document library (synced from workspace) |
| Memory | `/memory` | Workspace memory file viewer |
| Notes | `/notes` | Persistent scratchpad |
| Requests | `/requests` | Incoming request queue |
| R&D | `/rd` | Research memos and status |
| Team | `/team` | Agent team roster configuration |
| Setup | `/setup` | DB health check, migration, seeding |

---

## Creating a New Instance

To spin up a second instance (e.g. for a business partner):

1. **Ask the human** for a new Neon connection string and Netlify token (same steps as first-time setup above)
2. **Create a new Netlify site** using the token
3. **Set env vars** — use `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANCE=biz` for business instances
4. **Deploy** the same codebase
5. **Visit `/setup`** → Run Migration → Seed Defaults
6. Done — fully independent instance with its own database

> **Instance types:** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANCE` to any label that makes sense (e.g., `personal`, `biz`, `client`). This value is used for display and can control feature flags if custom pages are added later.

```

**Database:** All tables are prefixed `mc_` and live in a single Neon Postgres database. The 22 core tables cover tasks, flips, agents, scanner, chat, docs, memory, and more.

**API pattern:** All routes follow the same pattern — `getDb()` from `lib/db.ts`, tagged template literal queries, `NextResponse.json()`.

**Instances:** The same codebase runs multiple isolated instances. Each points to its own Neon DB via `DATABASE_URL`. `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANCE` controls UI feature flags.
